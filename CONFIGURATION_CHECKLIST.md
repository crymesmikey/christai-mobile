## üö® Common Issues

1. **"Firebase service account key not found"**

   - Ensure base64 string is complete (no line breaks)

2. **"OpenAI API key not found"**
   - Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env
   - Check API key format (should start with 'sk-')

3. **"Network request failed"**
   - Ensure backend server is running
   - Check that mobile app's backendUrl matches server address

4. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify Firebase Auth is enabled
   - Check Firebase config in app.json

## üìù Environment Variables Template

Copy this to your `server/.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=your-base64-encoded-service-account-here
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
PORT=3000
```

## üîê Security Reminders

- Never commit .env files
- Keep API keys secure
- Use test mode for initial setup
- Configure proper Firebase security rules for production
